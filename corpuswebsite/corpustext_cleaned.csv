noted and confirmed
he has very good knowledge of the whole process of installation
learning target achieved
she has knowledge of this topic and can identify and use the devices
i assigned him two tasks one was to learn the basics of software engineering that is building architecture and the software process work flaw and he has done them wellwanted him to learn git so that we can be working remotely as he learns thereforewill be monitoring his code from githubrealized that previously he knew nothing about git but now he knows something that can get him started
